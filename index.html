<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm Tatyana Venanzi, based in Seattle, WA, alongside my husband Matt and our furry pup Chip. 
  My background includes roles at tech giants like Meta, Google, and Tableau as a technical recruiter, where I was inspired by the fascinating projects underway. 
  Eager to dive into coding, I sought out workshops and found my match with Code the Dream. 
  Along this journey, I've gained valuable skills and embarked on exciting projects. 
  While I'm still honing my craft as a developer, I'm thrilled about the possibilities ahead. 
  Stay tuned for updates on my journey and new projects!</p>
